# calvin.larimo.re
My personal website. (aka the one you are currently on)

## Technology Stack
calvin.larimo.re is built using the hyper-advanced bleeding-egde futuristic stack of:
- [Eleventy](https:/11ty.dev)
- ... actually thats it it's just 11ty

I know, it's a lot to take in. Hopefully one day you can be as advanced of a web dev as me.
In all seriousness, I just wanted it to be easy to add new pages, and markdown is literally the best invention since type safety.
The source code is available [here]({{ contacts.github.url }}/calvin.larimo.re) if you want to read it for some reason.
Oh it's also built, deployed, and hosted using GitHub Pages and Actions, but I left that out because it ruins the joke.

Eleventy lets the site be 100% static and Javascript-free (try running it with JS disabled!)

## *Style*
The ~~editor~~ website theme is [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox), and the font is [Fixedsys Excelsior (w/ Ligatures)](https://github.com/kika/fixedsys). Despite using the Windows console font, I do use Linux, I swear (arch btw).
The general layout is *vaguely* based on vim (notably the character-width borders) but has clearly been heavily altered to work as, ya know, a website.

## Mobile Support
calvin.larimo.re is mobile-friendly, because it's all just basic html and a `max-width` css rule. The way my name splits on mobile-sized displays looks neat, but the ideal experience is definitely on a tablet or desktop.
